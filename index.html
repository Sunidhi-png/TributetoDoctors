      <h2><strong>A tribute to frontline corona warriors–Doctors who sacrificed their life while saving patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</strong></h2><br>
      <img class="img1" src="snapshots/virus-img.jpg" alt="virus-img">
      <p class"intro">The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.<br>
        While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs. On occasion of the Doctors' Day, the stories of the medical heroes are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.

      <p>The recent wave of corona virus is spreading like a ‘tsunami’ in India. As on April 23, 2021, the COVID-19 cases have crossed the 15.9 million, with 1,85,000 deaths. The 2nd wave is evolving at a phenomenal speed as compared to the 1st wave. There could be several factors responsible for the increased number of cases in the second wave. It is observed that the mutant virus has more effective transmission capability and its incubation period is also lesser. There has been a widespread disregard to the ‘Covid Appropriate Behaviours or CAB’ by the public and the quality of masks used are highly variable. N-95 masks are not much favored masks in India, due to their higher costs and the majority public are using either the indigenous masks made of clothes or are repeatedly using the same and worn out masks. The sharp rise can also be attributed to the higher testing; but, the doubts have been raised about the quality of testing as several cases of positive Covid-19 symptoms are reported as negative on the RT-PCR test.</p>
      <p>It has been stated that several factors could have led to rise in reproduction number (R0) in India. If the number of COVID-19 cases rises on day to day basis with the current phenomenal speed; there will be the exhaustion of resources and manpower. There is an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen supply, medicines, and ventilators across the country for COVID-19 patients. Although there is no significant percentage increase in the death rate in the second wave, but due to alarmingly high number of infections, the total death numbers are disappointingly high. Therefore, there is an urgent need for temporary but timely establishment of the hospitals that can save thousands of lives. Since, there no end to this clamity visible in the near future, the population has to learn to live with it in the most careful and safe manner and follow the CAB strictly. It is obvious that the prevention is better than cure for this disease and all the possible measures such as engagement and participation of public in controlling the disease, strict implementation of COVID Appropriate Behaviors (i.e, social distancing, use of face masks, and hand sanitation), mini lockdowns, night curfews, micro containments, etc must be implemented and observed by the Public.

    <h2><strong>Risks and Challenges faced by the Doctors during Covid-19 Second Wave</strong></h2>
    <br><br>

    <p>Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.</p>
    <p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.</p>
    <p>Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.</p>
