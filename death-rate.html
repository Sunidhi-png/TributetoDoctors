       <p>These are some among <strong>800 doctor deaths</strong> that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has counted in the second wave of Covid-19 this year. A majority were from Bihar and Delhi, as per the IMA, which has maintained a state-wise registry of doctors who died of Covid-19.</p>
       <p>“So far, we have the data of 800 doctors in our registry and initial observations indicate that a majority were yet to be fully vaccinated. Not many had got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,” Dr Lele said, adding that they were also looking at data where young doctors had succumbed to Covid-19 and, among primary reasons, could be exposure to high viral load in ICUs or CCUs. He, however, said the analysis was underway.</p>
       <p>According to the state-wise list of doctors who died in the IMA Covid registry, 128 medicos were from Delhi, 115 from Bihar and 79 from Uttar Pradesh, who succumbed to the infection. West Bengal reported 62 deaths of doctors followed by 51 in Tamil Nadu, 44 in Rajasthan, 42 in Andhra Pradesh, 39 each in Gujarat and Jharkhand, 37 in Telangana, 36 in Odisha, 24 in Kerala and 23 in Maharashtra. Haryana reported 19 deaths while Assam reported 10. Last year, the toll among this high-risk group was 754. Then, the highest numbers were from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.</p>
       <p>According to Dr Rohan Krishnan, national vice-president of Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), there was no data on how many doctors had died after being administered one dose of the vaccine. “However, according to available information, it is likely that few would have succumbed after both doses of vaccination. There were, however, several doctors who did get infected after the dose but 99 per cent recovered,” he said.</p>

       <h3 class="headd2">Doctors and Health Care Workers are facing several challenges during COVID-19 pandemic:</h3>
       <p><strong>A) Shortages of Personal Protective Equipments:</strong> Most health care facilities in India are facing shortages of personal protective equipments (PPE), including face masks, gowns, and respirators. Either the hospitals do not have these available in adequate numbers or they cannot afford to purchase the PPEs. In these extraordinary times, the health care providers must adapt and be flexible so that HCWs continue to safeguard themselves, their colleagues, their families, and their patients in this crisis.<br>
       <strong>B) Long working hours:</strong> It is becoming apparent from the reports from across the world that the long duty hours of the HCW is a major risk factor for them to acquire infection and hence it is mandatory they work in shorter shifts, based on a strict rota.<br>
       <strong>C) Violence against HCW:</strong> It is highly disturbing and demoralizing to see the HCW on duty are facing violence against them from some irresponsible public, within the hospitals and in the community surveillance work. It damages and dampen the work of HCW and may ultimately affect the health care of the public.<br>
       <strong>D) Increased risk of infection:</strong> The reports are coming in from across the world that several HCW are getting infected or dying due to COVID-19. In Spain, HCW have accounted for at least 14% of total COVID-19 cases. The hospitals and isolation centres are getting overloaded, essential medical equipments are scarce and the doctors and nursing staff are stretched thin. The high viral load in hospital settings may make healthcare workers particularly susceptible to the disease.<br>
       <strong>E) Social and Family impacts:</strong> Indeed the Medicine is a humanitarian profession, and the HCW have a duty to care for the sick. By willingly entering into this profession, they have implicitly agreed to accept the risks involved in it. However, they need to balance their obligations as professionals with their duties to their family members too. The risk to personal health from the coronavirus is alarming enough, but the risk of infecting their families because of exposure on the job is unjustified and not acceptable. The HCW have also been facing a sort of ‘ostracisation’ by society. Several HCW have been asked to vacate their rented accommodation on the presumption that they may carry and spread this disease from their place of work (hospitals) to society.

     <q>Doctors and Health Care Workers have played an important role during the Covid-19 pandemic. We will forever be grateful to them.</q>
